# Knapsack-problem
Brute force method

Firstly, you need to create *.txt file with the list of items(ItemName ItemWeight ItemPrice;
max items count is 100, but you can change it in numericUpDown1 properties)
For example:
Cup 1 10
Laptop 4.2 20000
Then set the capacity of a backpack(max capacity is 1000, but you can change it in numericUpDown2 properties).
"Details" function is developing now.
When you're ready(data table is filled, capacity is set up) click the "Start" button. 
The solution set for your setup will appear in the "Result" tab.
You can save the solution in *.txt file, by clicking the "Save solution" button.
